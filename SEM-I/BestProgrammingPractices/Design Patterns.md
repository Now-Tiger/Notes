- General, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problems when designing an application.
- Unlike a library or a framework which can be inserted and used right away. Design pattern is more of a template to approach the problem at hand.
- It is a solution to general problems that software dev. faced during the software dev. 

# Usage of Design Patterns
Design Patterns have two main usages in software development.
- **Common platform for developers** - Design patterns provide standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. **Ex. Singleton pattern deals with the use of single object**. So the developers familiar with the singleton design pattern with make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following singleton pattern.
- **Best Practices** - Design patterns have been evolved over long period of time, as they provide solutions to certain problems faced during software dev. **Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.**
# Types
1. **Creational Patterns**
	 - These design patterns **provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic**, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator.
	 - Provides flexibility to decide and create objects depending on the given use case.
1. **Structural Patterns**
2. **Behavioral Patterns**
