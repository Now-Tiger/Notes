- Lowest layer of the OSI Model.
- Responsible for the physical connection between the devices.
- Contains information in the form of bits. - Responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to next.
- When receiving data, this layer get the signal received and converts bits in the form of 0s and 1s and send them to the **Data Link layer**
- **Functionalities of Physical Layer** : __Bit synchronization, Bit rate control, Physical topologies, Transmission Mode.__
