- The data in the transport layer is referred to as __Segments__.
- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.
- It is responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
- The transport layer **carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device, and error control, checking if data was received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again**
- Functionalities of transport layer:
	- **Segmentation and Reassembly**
	- **Service Point Addressing**
