## Client 
- Program running on a **local machine** **requesting service(s) from a server**.
- A client program is  a finite program meaning service is started by the user and terminates the service when the purpose of that service is fulfilled by the server.

## Server
- Program that **runs on the remote machine** providing services to the clients.
- When the client requests for a service, then server opens the door for the incoming requests, but it **never initiates the service**.

## Client-Server Architecture / Model
- Client and server architecture is a model in which computers such as servers provide the network services to other computers called clients to perform user based tasks.
## Advantages -
1. **Centralized**. 
2. **Security**
3. **Performance**
4. **Scalability**

## Peer-to-peer Architecture.
- Simple network of computers, first came into existence in 1970s.
- Here each computer acts as a node for file sharing within a formed network. 
- **Each node acts as a server and thus no central server in the network**.
- **A [peer-to-peer](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/peer-to-peer-p2p) (P2P) network is a decentralized communication model between two peers also known as [nodes](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/node), which can communicate with each other without the need for a central server.**
- This allows sharing of huge load of data. Tasks are equally divided amongst the nodes. load is equally shared as well.
- **For network to stop working, all nodes need to individually stop working**.
- **Principles of P2P architectures such as concept of decentralization are used in blockchain**.
