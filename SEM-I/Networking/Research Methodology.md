# Research Design
**Constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurements and data analysis.**
Refers to the strategy to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way, thereby ensuring to address the research problem effectively.
	
 - **Research Design Must contain**:
	1. **A clear statement of the research problem**.      
	2. **Procedure** and **techniques** to be used for gathering information.
	3. Population to be studied.
	4. Methods to used in the processing and analyzing data. 

## Degrees of Problem Definition
![[Drawing 2023-09-01 02.03.08.excalidraw]]
1. **Exploratory Research**  - (Unaware of problem) 
2. **Descriptive Research**  - (aware of problem)
3. **Casual Research** - (Problem Clearly Defined)

| |**Exploratory** | **Descriptive** | **Casual** |
|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------------|
|**Emphasis**| Discovery of ideas and insights | Freq of occurrences | Determine cause effect |
|**Features** | Flexible, Unstructured | Hypothesis based, structured | Variable control |
|**Techniques used** | Focus groups, in-depth interview, mostly qualitative research | Survey, observation, panel data, mostly quantitative research | Experimentation

1. **Exploratory research**
   - methodology **_approach that investigates research questions that have not previously been_** studied in depth.
   - **Data collection methods**: Surveys/Polls, Interviews, Focus group discussion.
   - Initial research conducted to clarify and define the nature of a problem.
   - Subsequent research is expected in this area.


2. **Descriptive Research** 
	- **aim to accurately and systematically describe a population**, situation or phenomenon. It **can answer what, where and how questions, but not why questions.**
	-  When to use - when research focus is to identify characteristics, frequencies, trends and categories.
	-  Descriptive research question examples 
		- **How has the Amsterdam housing market changed over the past 20 years?**
		- **Do customers of company X prefer product X or product Y?**
	-  How descriptive research is conducted
		- Start with a hypothesis
		- Test hypothesis using statistical techniques
		- Theoretical Background
		- Add value to the existing literature.
	-  Data Collection - **Surveys, Observations, Case studies**.


3. **Casual Research**
	- Causal research is also known as [explanatory research](https://www.questionpro.com/blog/explanatory-research/). It’s a type of **research that examines if there’s a cause-and-effect relationship between two separate events**.
	- This would occur when there is a change in one of the independent variables, which is causing changes in the dependent variable.
	- Casual Research Examples 
		- Advertising Research
		- Customer Loyalty Research
		- Educational Research
	- Causal or explanatory research helps organizations understand how their current activities and behaviors will impact them in the future.

# Deductive Reasoning
**Deductive reasoning** is a logical approach **where you progress from general ideas to specific conclusions**.
Also called deductive logic or **top-down reasoning**.
**Process** -> Theory - Hypothesis - Observation - Confirmation
Example:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Premise**|All insects have exactly six legs.|
|**Premise**|Spiders have eight legs.|
|**Conclusion**|Therefore, spiders are not insects.|

# Inductive Reasoning
Method of drawing conclusions by **going from the specific to the general**.
Also called as **bottom-up reasoning**.
Inductive reasoning is a logical approach to making inferences, or conclusions. People often use inductive reasoning informally in everyday situations.

|Stage|Example 1|Example 2|
|---|---|---|
|Specific observation|Nala is an orange cat and she purrs loudly.|Baby Jack said his first word at the age of 12 months.|
|Pattern recognition|Every orange cat I’ve met purrs loudly.|All **observed** babies say their first word at the age of 12 months.|
|General conclusion|All orange cats purr loudly.|All babies say their first word at the age of 12 months.|
