- The session layer **creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices**, and also ensures security.
- Responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends.
- The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transfer—if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.
